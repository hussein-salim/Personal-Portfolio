# Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my Personal Portfolio Website project! This project is a showcase of my skills, projects, and professional journey as a Frontend Developer. The goal is to apply various CSS techniques to enhance the appearance and responsiveness of the website created in a previous HTML-only project.

## Project Overview

In this project, I styled the HTML website structure created previously. The focus was on learning how to use CSS to create responsive layouts, apply color and typography, and enhance the overall design of the website. The mockups provided served as a guide to ensure the layout looks good on different screen sizes.

## Submission Requirements

- A fully styled, responsive website with the same structure as the previous project.
- Consistent use of a chosen color scheme and typography.
- Proper use of CSS techniques like Flexbox, media queries, and the box model.
- A responsive navigation bar and a well-styled contact form.

## Bonus Points

To achieve bonus points, I implemented the following:

- **Google Fonts:** Used Google Fonts to enhance the typography of the website.
- **Hosting:** Explored GitHub Pages or Cloudflare Pages to host the website for free.
- **Dark Mode Support:** Added support for dark mode using CSS variables.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Markup language used to structure the content.
- **CSS3:** Used for styling the website and making it responsive.
- **JavaScript:** Added interactivity to the navigation menu.
- **Google Fonts:** Enhanced the typography of the website.
- **GitHub Pages/Cloudflare Pages:** For hosting the website.
